feat: Add date awareness to MCP search and expose ingestion pipeline

This commit fixes the inability to retrieve articles based on temporal
queries (e.g., "What's new today?", "Recent NVIDIA articles") by
implementing date awareness throughout the entire pipeline.

Changes:

1. Query Transformation (mcp/rag_query_transformer.py):
   - Enhanced query transformer with current date context
   - Added temporal query handling (today, recent, latest, newest)
   - Transforms temporal queries into date-specific searches
   - Improved code style and formatting

2. Ingestion Pipeline (private/):
   - Modified html_cleaner.py to prepend metadata headers (date, title, source)
   - Updated main.py to pass metadata to HTML cleaner
   - Ensures every RAG chunk contains publication date context
   - Added complete ingestion pipeline to repository

3. Documentation:
   - Added DATE_AWARENESS_FIX.md with detailed explanation
   - Added CODE_REVIEW_DATE_FIX.md with comprehensive code review
   - Documents root cause, solution, and deployment steps

4. Repository Structure:
   - Updated .gitignore to include private/ ingestion code
   - Exposed complete data pipeline for transparency

Impact:
- Temporal queries now retrieve relevant date-specific articles
- Better search quality for "today", "recent", "latest" queries
- Complete visibility into ingestion and processing pipeline
- Every chunk contains "Publication Date:" header for date matching

Closes date awareness issue.
